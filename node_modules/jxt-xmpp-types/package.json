If the `prepped` flag is set to `true`, then the JID will be treated as having been processed with StringPrep.\n\n- `jidSub(ns, subName, prepped)`\n\nWork with sub-elements with XMPP JIDs as text content. If the `prepped` flag is set to `true`, then the JID will be treated as having been processed with StringPrep.\n\n- `tzoSub(ns, subName)`\n\nReturn an integer value compatible with JavaScripts datetime API, for child elements whose text content looks like: `'[+|-]hh:mm'`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Created By\n\nIf you like this, follow [@lancestout](http://twitter.com/lancestout) on twitter.\n",
